# Build Three Real-World Python Applications
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Build Three Real-World Python Applications`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## File Structure
There is one branch for this course containing three chapter folders corresponding to the three chapters in the course. Inside these chapter folders are the coding exercise files. The naming convention for the exercise files is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 

All coding exercise files will have a beginning and an end state, for example '02_03e' would be the ending file for the third movie in the second chapter. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` file contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` file contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
